        "Surprisingly, the Mistral v0.2 with a simple prompt achieves the highest accuracy, while the Mistral v0.3 with a simple prompt performs the worst. The confusion matrices reveal a key pattern: the v0.3 models tend to produce many False Positives, labeling non-sexist tweets as sexist.\n",
        "This observation led us to a hypothesis: the rising interest in aligning LLMs with ethics and human values, including gender equality, may have influenced the RLHF phase of v0.3. There might have been adjustments aimed at improving the model’s sensitivity to sexist content, however, this could inadvertently introduce a bias that increases the likelihood of misclassifying non-sexist content. It is essential to consider also alternative factors as well, such as differences in training data distribution.\n",
        "From https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3:\n",

        "\n",
        "Until now, we adopted a straightforward approach in the selection of the examples by choosing the **first examples** in the demonstration dataset. This naive method provided a baseline for comparison but did not account for any relationship between the current sample and the selected demonstrations.\n",
        "\n",
        "To improve upon this, we experimented with a more dynamic approach. Specifically, we implemented a selection mechanism based on **semantic similarity**. In this strategy, examples for the demonstrations were dynamically chosen based on their semantic similarity to the current sample. The intuition behind this approach is that selecting examples more closely related to the current sample may provide better contextual relevance, potentially leading to improved model performance. Semantic similarity was measured using euclidean distance between the embedding vectors.\n",
        "We used LangChain as library and an embedding model from HF for this experiment.\n",

        "By comparing these two strategies, we aim to evaluate whether tailoring the demonstration examples to each sample improves the model's overall performances.\n"
